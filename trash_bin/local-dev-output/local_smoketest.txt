# Local Smoke Test Report

**Status**: SKIPPED

## Reason
The build agent environment lacks `php` and `composer`. Therefore, the following actions could not be performed:
- Starting the Laravel backend server (`php artisan serve`).
- Running database migrations.
- Executing curl requests against the local API.

## Manual Validation Required
Please follow the `final-local-instructions.md` to start the servers and perform the following checks manually:
1.  Login with `admin@kapda.com`.
2.  Create a test order.
3.  Upload an image.
4.  Verify the order appears in the list.
