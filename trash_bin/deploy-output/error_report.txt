# Build Error Report

## Missing Dependencies
The following tools were not found in the environment, preventing a full production build:
- **Composer**: Required to install Laravel dependencies (`vendor` folder).
- **PHP**: Required to run artisan commands (key generation, migrations).

## Impact
- **backend-deploy.zip**: Contains the source code but is missing the `vendor` directory. You **MUST** run `composer install` on the destination server or on a machine with Composer installed.
- **Smoke Tests**: Could not be run locally because a local PHP server could not be started.
- **Migrations**: Database migrations were not verified locally.

## Mitigation
The `final_deploy_checklist.md` has been updated to include explicit steps for running `composer install` on the server.
